            <h2>Resillient architecture for self healing mechanism </h2>
            <p>I'm currently working on a project titled "Self-Healing AI for Application Server", where I'm developing an intelligent system capable of automatically detecting faults, anomalies, or failures in web applications and triggering corrective actions without human intervention. The goal is to enhance application uptime, reduce manual recovery efforts, and make server environments more resilient using Machine Learning, automation, and monitoring tools.</p>
